## Infinity Dice
- Infinity dice. It asks users n = how many sides they want on their dice. Starts looping, calls subroutine- rolldice and gives them a random number between 1 to n. Asks user if they want to roll again. If user says yes, they roll the die again from 1 to n. If no, then the game quits. There is a restart option also. If you respond to roll dice again question with "restart", it asks you for input n and resets the value of n. It uses while loop, rolldice subroutine, imported library - random, if, elif, else statements, continue, break and exit function etc. 
- This has a lot of errors and unnecessary repetition. It isn't practical since python has a limit against recursions which is exactly what my code is creating. But this is something I'm very proud of.
