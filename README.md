# A Beginner Guide To Python üöÄ

Welcome! This is my personal journey into learning Python ‚Äî one of the most powerful and versatile programming languages in the world.

Originally started as a 100 Days of Code challenge, this project has now evolved into a long-term learning log, code base, and open-source journal of everything I discover as I explore Python, one concept at a time.
As of now I have started with Replit 100 days of code, I'll continue to expand as I learn more.

## ‚ú® Goals
- Learn Python fundamentals deeply

- Practice clean, readable code

## Structure üìä

Learning python is no easy work. So to keep this repository from getting cluttered, I have divided it into specific folders, like for replit's challenge I have divided days into folders with an increment of 20 days. So, we have a folder named "day14_to_day20" then "day21_to_day40" and I'll keep building up more as I progress more.

Now each of these folders have the template- DayX_What I built/What I learnt that day. 
These folders will have 2 files:
- README.md - Gives description of what I learnt, what I built and what new things I used to build the program I did build lol.
- Code.py - my code for that program
- Beginning to add videos of running my code
