## Explore Print
Learnt: variables for print function like  **end=" "** , **sep=" "** :
- **end=" "**: whatever we put in between the apostrophe symbol will be what separates 2 different messages. We can leave it empty if we want no space between our previous message and the next message we are going to write. For eg: we write *print("hello everyone", end ="")* and for the next line we type *print("Welcome back to Learning Python!")*. This will give us- *hello everyonewelcome back to Learning Python!*. We get this because we kept the apostrophe empty.
- **sep=" "**: Unlike 'end', this is used for the same print function. For eg: we write *print("hello world", sep="")*, this will give us - *helloworld* with no space in between since we chose to keep our 'sep' empty with nothing in between the apostrophe.
