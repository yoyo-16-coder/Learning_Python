## Number Guessing Game
- As it says. Picks a number between 1 to 100. Asks the user to guess the number. They are given a limited amount of tries. If they suceed they get a well done and are asked if want to play again. If not, they are told the answer and asked to try again? 
- Uses same concept as before. while loop. if, elif, else statements. continue, break functions.
- Update: From new lessons, I have added an import random function, so you can play the game multiple times.
